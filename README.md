Steps to follow to run application on your machine:
1)Install nodejs on your machine. Go to the official website and press the big green button. Find the appropriate version for your OS.
2)For simplicity, I have pushed the node modules, already. All dependancies are saved.
3)Cd into the project. 
4)Watch the database on port 8000. Use the command: json-server --watch db.json --port 800
5)Enter the command to start the application. Use the command: nodemon, nodemon start or nodemon --port 3000
6)Open your browser to localhost:3000. Create an account using your credentials. Or use the following:

In the case that the application is giving you an error, run the following commands:
npm install json-server -g
npm install nodemon -g
